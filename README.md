Hello! My name is Noah Padgett and I am most interested in creating functional scripts that can be used to automate IT work.
I am primarily working in a mix of powershell and python 3. 
I am based in North Carolina where I was born and raised. PM me if you have any questions about the work on this page.

My crowing achievment is my 'report_generator.py' script. It takes data from my orginzation, analyizes it, and creates
a google spreadsheet. Check it out!
